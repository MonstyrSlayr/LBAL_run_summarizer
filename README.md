## Usage
Run the program, and then open Luck Be A Landlord and play the game. The program will scan your save file as you play the game and create a run summary when the game is over.

## Installation
Go to the [Releases tab](https://github.com/MonstyrSlayr/LBAL_run_summarizer/releases) and download a file for your os.

Note: This program has only been tested for Windows, and I have no clue if it will work for Mac and Linux.

## Running Locally
Run the install.sh file to create an executable.
